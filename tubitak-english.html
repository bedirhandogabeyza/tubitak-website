font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Çinili Bath is an Ottoman-era bathhouse
located in Üsküdar, one of the historical districts of Istanbul. Although it is
not clearly known when it was built, it is dated to the late 16th or early 17th
century.One of the reasons why the bath is called &quot;Tiled&quot; is that it
is decorated with traditional tile work. These tiles add a unique aesthetic to
the walls, domes and fontans of the bath. Throughout history, Çinili Bath has
hosted many famous people and has been a cultural meeting point. The historical
atmosphere and tile decorations offer visitors the opportunity to experience
the Ottoman bath culture. Restored and still in use today, Çinili Bath
continues to contribute to Istanbul's cultural heritage by preserving its
historical texture.</span></p>
