Sultan Abdülmecid bought this mansion for his sister Adile Sultan (1826-1899) on March 31, 1856. Sultan Abdülaziz had the mansion demolished between 1861 and 1870 and a massive masonry palace was built in its place. It is said that its architect was Sarkis Balyan. In fact, in the list of works of this architect, there is a building called "Palace of the Sultans" in Kandilli. It is also said that Fındıklı, Kuruçeşme seaside palaces and Silâhtarağa and Validebağı mansions belonged to Adile Sultan. It is still unknown which of these palaces and mansions, of which there are five including the one in Kandilli, really belong to Adile Sultan, and it can be said that this is an issue that needs to be investigated. However, it is known and accepted that the Kandilli Palace, where he spent the summers, and the Fındıklı coastal palace, where he died, belonged to him.</span>
